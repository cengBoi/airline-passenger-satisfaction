## ðŸš€ Problem Definition
Today, air travel has become an indispensable mode of transportation for many people. However, the air travel experience can vary depending on many factors, which can affect the overall satisfaction level of passengers. In this project, we consider an air passenger satisfaction forecasting problem. Our dataset includes a variety of characteristics such as passengers' gender, customer type, age, travel purpose, class, flight distance, and satisfaction levels with a range of services. Our main objective is to determine a traveler's satisfaction level with air travel based on these attributes.

This classification task is divided into two main classes: "Satisfied" and "Neutral or Dissatisfied". Using classification algorithms, the satisfaction level of a passenger can be predicted based on the characteristics in our dataset. This prediction can provide important information for airlines to improve service quality and enhance the passenger experience.

This study aims to provide important insights using data mining and machine learning techniques, focusing on customer satisfaction in the air travel industry. The machine learning algorithms used include K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Network.
